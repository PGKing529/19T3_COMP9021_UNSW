### 0x02 Evaluate
- For non-background students, COMP9021 is quite a big challenge, less connection between the lectures and quizzes. The assignments assume that you are familiar with the knowledge and structure involved in the above details.

- For students who have background, COMP9021 is worth to enrol, the quality of quizzes and assignments are pretty high. After finish COMP9021, I continue to do the leetcode, I feel like the ability of problem solving has improved.

### 0x03 PS
- Good course to improve WAM.

- Once again, Pay attention of **PLAGIARISM**!! If you share you codes or copy from others, you will receice the Warning Email, receiving more may affect your grades.
